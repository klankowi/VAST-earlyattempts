Swept area = velocity (m/min) * duration (min) * headrope length (m) * wing spread as fraction of headrope length
							OR
Swept area = length of path (m) * wing spread (m)
							OR
Swept area = length of path (m) * 2/3 footrope length (m)

#### Trawl surveys ####

# NEFSC BTS
	3 knots (92.6 meters/min) for 20 mins duration
	18.288 headrope, 30.48 footrope
	Depth variable wing spread between 8 and 15 m

# MASS DMF Industry
	HAS NETMIND DATA TO MEASURE NET GEOMETRY
	3 knots (92.6 meters/ min) for 30 mins duration
	25 m headrope,  16.15 m spread based on lower wing spread
	Averages to 0.0449 sq km

# MASS DMF Inshore
	2.5 knots (77.1667 meters/ min) for 20 mins duration
	11.8872 m headrope, 15.5448 footrope, unknown spread
	Assuming 2/3 footrope value, spread is probably 10.3632 m (this seems long given headrope)
	Based on other 3/4 in North Atlantic type otter trawls, spread is probably 8.5 m
	Averages to 0.0132 sq km
