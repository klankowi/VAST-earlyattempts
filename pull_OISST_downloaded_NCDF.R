# Adapted from code written by Kimberly Bastille and Sarah Gaichas
# Theoretically should be able to download NetCDF files directly into R from
# NOAA, but recently the files have downloaded as corrupt and not openable.
# Manual downloading of yearly NetCDF files from 
# (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html) is slower
# but more reliable. This code requires those NetCDF files to already be 
# manually downloaded from NOAA's website and placed into the project directory.
